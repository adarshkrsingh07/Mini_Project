## üè¶ Automated Teller Machine (ATM) ‚Äì Project Overview ##

This project focuses on designing and developing a secure and intelligent Automated Teller Machine (ATM) system that integrates advanced authentication mechanisms and AI-based facial recognition to enhance user experience and security.

üîπ Key Features

Facial Recognition using Eigenfaces & CompreFace AI
Uses machine learning algorithms for real-time face authentication.

OTP-Based Secure Transactions
Implements one-time password verification via mobile for additional security.

Encrypted Data Transmission
Ensures end-to-end encryption between ATM and bank servers to prevent data theft.

Li-Fi Technology Integration (Optional)
Uses Li-Fi for faster and more secure data transmission compared to traditional Wi-Fi.

Biometric & Multi-Factor Authentication
Supports facial recognition, PIN, and OTP-based verification for layered security.
